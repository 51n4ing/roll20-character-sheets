## Repeating Sections

### General

Sometimes, you may have a type of object where there may be one or more instances, and it's not known ahead of time how many there are. A good example of this is the Skills listing for a Character in Savage Worlds. Roll20's sheets allow you to define a template for each item in the section, and the player can then add as many of these in the listing as they need.

**Example:**

````html
<h3>Skills</h3>
<fieldset class="repeating_skills">
  <button type="roll" name="roll_skill" value="/em uses @{skillname}, and rolls [[@{dtype}]]"></button>
  <input type="text" name="attr_skillname" value="">
  <select name="attr_dtype" class="dtype"> 
    <option value="d6">d6</option>
    <option value="d10">d10</option>
  </select>
</fieldset>
````

### Definition & Restrictions

To define a repeating section, create a `<fieldset>` element with a unique `class` that starts with the `repeating_` prefix, followed by a name written in lowercase without underscores. Inside the `<fieldset>`, place the input fields that each instance of the section should have.

**Important Points:**

- Each repeating section should have a unique name, and you **cannot use underscores**. For example, use `repeating_melee` or `repeating_meleeweapon`, **not** `repeating_melee_weapon`.
- Attribute names within one repeating section don't have to be unique compared to attribute names in another section. For instance, both `repeating_melee` and `repeating_ranged` can have an attribute named `attr_name`, as they don't affect each other.
- Class names should be all lowercase. If not, you may encounter issues with launching buttons in a repeating section from macros and scripts.
- Nesting repeating sections is not possible. However, you can vote on the suggestion in the [Roll20 forums](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/123456/nested-repeating-sections-request) and comment on why this feature is desired.
- Referencing buttons in repeating sections behaves slightly differently than in regular parts of a sheet.
- All attributes in a repeating section should have a unique name that isn't already used by a "normal" attribute outside of the repeating section. For example, if you have `attr_spellname` in your repeating section, you cannot have a "normal" `attr_spellname` outside of the repeating section, but it's fine to have `attr_spellname` inside another repeating section.

**Good Example:**

````html
<fieldset class="repeating_spell-level1">
  <input type="text" name="attr_spellname">
</fieldset>
<fieldset class="repeating_spell-level2">
  <input type="text" name="attr_spellname">
</fieldset>
````

**Bad Example:**

````html
<input type="text" name="attr_spellname">
<fieldset class="repeating_spell-level1">
  <input type="text" name="attr_spellname">
</fieldset>
````

In the good example, the attribute `attr_spellname` is only present inside repeating sections, allowing its reuse in this way. In the bad example, the attribute `attr_spellname` is present both as a "normal" attribute and within a repeating section, which should be avoided.

- Repeating sections are hard or impossible to create around an HTML `<table>` and are recommended to be placed within a single cell if you insist on trying to use `<table>`.
- Using `<table>` inside repeating sections might interfere with sheetworkers. Refer to the [forum discussion](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/123456/button-sheetworker-not-working) for more details.

When the sheet is displayed, Roll20 will automatically include:

- **Add** buttons, allowing players to add as many of each item as needed.
- **Modify** buttons, which, when pressed, enable players to drag and reorder items in the repeating section, along with showing the delete button (`#`) for deleting individual items.

Each item will have its own set of fields (in the example above, each has its own `attr_dtype` and `attr_skillname`).

Internally, each repeating item is stored in an attribute like so: `repeating_skills_-ABC123_dtype` or `repeating_skills_$0_skillname`. The rowID (the `-ABC123` part of the previous example) will never change for a repeating section row, so you can reference it in macros, abilities, and API scripts. New rows that you add will be randomly assigned a new unique ID. By default, rows are ordered in the order in which they were created, the oldest at the top.

### Styling Repeating Sections

It's possible to style your repeating sections in a variety of ways. However, you can't just write your CSS as though the `<fieldset>` that's in your HTML source is what the user is viewing. After writing the code for your repeating section, here is how it will look when rendered to the user:

````html
<fieldset class="repeating_my-repeating-section" style="display: none;">
    <!-- my-repeating-section HTML -->
</fieldset>
<div class="repcontainer" data-groupname="repeating_my-repeating-section">
    <div class="repitem">
        <div class="itemcontrol">
            <button class="btn btn-danger pictos repcontrol_del">#</button>
            <a class="btn repcontrol_move">â‰¡</a>
        </div>
        <!-- my-repeating-section HTML -->
    </div>
    <!-- there will be a div.repitem for each item the user has actually added to the sheet -->
</div>
<div class="repcontrol" data-groupname="repeating_my-repeating-section">
    <button class="btn repcontrol_edit">Modify</button>
    <button class="btn repcontrol_add">+Add</button>
</div>
````

When you click the **Modify** button, the **Add** button is set to `display: none` and the text of the **Modify** button is changed to "Done". When you click **Done**, the **Add** button is set to `display: inline-block` and the text of the **Done** button is changed back to "Modify". While modifying repitems, the repcontainer gains the class "editmode".

**Example of Multiple Repeating Items per Row:**

````css
.repcontainer[data-groupname="repeating_skills"] > .repitem {
    display: inline-block;
}
````

**Note:** You do not prefix the `rep*` classes with `sheet-`!

Remember to use the `[data-groupname="repeating_..."]` attribute selector if you want to apply the style to a single repeating section. If you want the style to apply to every repeating section on your sheet, simply use the `.repcontainer` selector without the attribute.

### Other Considerations

- Be cautious with HTML elements inside repeating sections, as some elements like `<table>` might cause conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- Always test your character sheet thoroughly to ensure that all buttons, macros, and API scripts work as expected.
